# MyToken Smart Contract

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

MyToken is a simple ERC-20 compliant smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for the creation, minting, and burning of a custom token named monkey (mny). The contract includes functions for minting new tokens to specific addresses and burning tokens from specific addresses, with appropriate checks and balances.

## Getting Started

### Installing

1. Clone the repository or download the smart contract file.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mytoken.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Solidity development environment, such as Remix IDE.

3. Ensure you have the necessary development tools installed, including Node.js, npm, and Truffle.

### Executing program

1. Compile the smart contract using Remix IDE or your preferred Solidity compiler.

2. Deploy the contract to your preferred Ethereum network (e.g., Ethereum mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby).

3. Interact with the deployed contract using Remix IDE or a web3 interface.

   Example commands:

   ```solidity
   // Minting tokens
   myTokenInstance.mint("0xYourAddress", 100);

   // Burning tokens
   myTokenInstance.burn("0xYourAddress", 50);
   ```

## Help

For common issues or troubleshooting, please refer to the following:

- Ensure you have sufficient ETH for gas fees when deploying and interacting with the contract.
- Make sure the contract address and ABI are correctly referenced in your web3 interface.

```bash
// If you encounter issues with deployment or interaction
npx truffle migrate --reset
```
